# Tab Library

A chrome extension that can save a window with all it's tabs and groups into a markdown library and then load it back. 

Tabs not in any groups will be placed as bullet points under the main heading, which will be the name of the file. Groups of tabs are turned into subheadings with bullet points of their respective tabs. The color of each group is placed next to it as an embedded image.
